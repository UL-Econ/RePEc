Title:  Are We There Yet? The Length of the Tendering Period under PPP in Ireland
Abstract:  The relative complexity of procurement under PPP means that tendering periods can be longer compared to traditional procurement models.  Reducing the tendering period is therefore an important challenge if Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is to deliver infrastructure on time and within budget.  Using data from 59 PPP projects in Ireland we find that the average tendering period has been 33.3 months.  Regression analysis shows that tendering periods have fallen over time and are positively but not strongly associated with the capital value of projects.  Tendering periods are longer for projects that do not involve private finance with the majority of such projects procured by local authorities.  We use a case study of PPP procurement by a local authority to explore these issues further.  The Dublin Waste to Energy PPP shows the complex array of factors that can impact on tendering periods some of which are outside the control of the procurement authority.

Title:  Privatisation and the Economic Performance of Irish Sugar/Greencore
Abstract:  As one of Irelands largest agri-business companies the Irish Sugar company played a key role in the countrys economic development in the twentieth century. The company was privatised in 1991 (under the new name Greencore) and has since transformed from a largely commodity-based agri-business into an international convenience food company. This paper analyses the financial and economic performance of the company before and after privatisation. It finds that the change from public to private ownership was not strongly associated with improved financial performance and productivity as the company had experienced rapid growth and improvement in the pre-privatisation period. These findings run counter to perspectives such as public choice theory that suggest a positive relationship between privatisation and company performance. Performance in the post-privatisation period was strongly influenced by greater exposure to market forces in the companys expanding food division. It is surprising that greater competition did not translate into improved overall performance.

Title:  Is theatre efficiency affected by the legal form type? A case study of German public theatres
Abstract:  The paper aims at exploring the economic efficiency of the performing arts organisations.    A parametric stochastic frontier approach is presented as a way of measuring the performance of cultural institutions. In particular, using German public theatres as a case study and summarising the empirical findings obtained in Zieba and Newman (2013), this paper examines how the efficiency of publicly funded performing arts firms, operating under different organisational structures, is affected by two types of shocks. First, we consider what happens to efficiency when there is a funding shock and second, we consider the effect on efficiency of an increase in competition. The identification of these effects was made possible by the natural experiment of the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The results suggest that theatres organised under public law are more efficient than theatres organised under private law. However, when exposed to the exogenous demand shock after reunification, the theatres organised under private law react positively to this competition shock as measured by their efficiency scores confirming that they better react to the changing market conditions than theatres organised as public legal forms.

Title:  Where they go, what they do and why it matters: The importance of geographic accessibility and social class for decisions relating to higher education institution type, degree level and field of study
Abstract:  The factors influencing the decision of school leavers to participate in higher education has been extensively investigated previously. This has mainly focused on the influence of characteristics such as parental education level, social class and spatial factors on the decision to participate in higher education at a broad level. However, given the influence the type of tertiary education pursued may have on future labour market outcomes, an understanding of the factors behind more specific higher education outcomes decisions is important. Within this context, this paper focuses on the influence of geographic accessibility and social class on young people when making decisions relating to higher education institution type, degree level and field of study pursued using a rich Irish dataset. We estimate this relationship using a bivariate probit framework and controlling for a range of other variables we find evidence of significant spatial and socio-economic effects on these higher education outcomes.

Title:  Student preferences for assignment systems: Results from a discrete choice experiment in Irish universities 
Abstract: Data from a discrete choice experiment is used to explore preference heterogeneity associated with assignment systems between students in three universities in Ireland. The motivation for the study arises from recent technological advances which have led to a significant increase in the use of online assignment systems in disciplines such as economics and statistics. Despite this, little research exists to understand student preferences for online assignment systems and whether similarities emerge between students across universities. To investigate this issue, we employ latent class and random parameters logit models to explore both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in students' tastes. Our findings reveal that significant heterogeneity in preferences is evident within and between students across the universities. The implications of this finding for the design of assignment systems are discussed.

Title:  Eliciting Individual Preferences for Pension Reform
Abstract:  Rising costs and changing demographics require that pension system reform is an important policy goal of most developed countries. While existing literature has explored issues such as the fiscal and redistributive impact of such reforms, few studies have been undertaken to investigate the preferences of individuals for various pension reforms. This paper aims to fill this gap and uses data from a discrete choice experiment conducted in Ireland to investigate individual preferences for alternative state pension schemes. In particular, we examine preferences for characteristics of means-tested, universal or earnings-related pension systems. Our results suggest that individuals' income and age group are important determinants of their preferences and that reform of the Irish pension system is warranted towards a more generous redistributive system.

Title:  An Experiment with Online and Paper Assignments: Grades, Completion Rates and Student Preferences 
Abstract: With the growth of online assignment tools across many courses in higher education, questions remain as to the impact of such tools on student learning and engagement. In this paper we present an experiment that attempts to measure these effects, as well as a survey aimed at gauging student preferences for traditional or online assignment formats. The results of this experiment comparing online assignments with paper assignments are mixed.  Students that complete paper assignments get a higher mark.  However, students are more likely to complete an online assignment.  These conflicting advantages require the educator to make trade-off when determining the assignment format to use.  When in doubt the educator might consider using technology as the results of a student survey presented in this paper revealed that the students preferred the online assignments - a result in line with the literature.  While the evidence is not conclusive it would appear that the reason for the preference is the ease with which they can complete the assignments.
