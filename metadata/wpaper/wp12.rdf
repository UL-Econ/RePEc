Title: Private Equity Leveraged Buyouts in European Telecoms: The Case of Eircom
Abstract: Highly leveraged buyouts (LBOs) of former state owned telecoms operators by private equity groups have occurred in a number of countries in recent years. This paper examines the case of Eircom in Ireland which has experienced five changes in ownership since full privatisation in 1999, two of which were LBOs. Enormous increases in Eircoms debt levels as a result of the LBOs resulted in the companys bankruptcy in 2012. This paper argues that this outcome was largely attributable to the short-termist strategies adopted by the private equity groups that assumed ownership of the enterprise. These strategies included high leverage, cash extraction and underinvestment in the fixed-line network which contributed to the demise of the enterprise and had wider economic and social effects. The Eircom case demonstrates the risks attendant to ownership of important network infrastructure by private equity groups and the need for regulatory safeguards to protect the public interest.

Title: SOE Policy and the Loss of Economic Sovereignty: The Case of Ireland
Abstract: The global financial crisis that erupted in 2008 has had enormous implications for the composition of the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector in many advanced economies around the world. The crisis resulted in the nationalisation of financial institutions in a number of economies and many countries are currently pursuing policies of privatisation to raise much needed revenues to tackle high levels of indebtedness. This paper describes the changes to the composition of the Irish SOE sector since the onset of the economic crisis in 2008 as well as its impact on the stated plans for the future of the SOE sector. The paper focuses on the question of privatisation and examines the conditionality with regard to the sale of state assets contained in the bailout agreement signed between the Irish government and the Troika. It highlights the uncertainty over the precise details of the conditionality with regard to privatisation in Ireland and compares this with the agreements forged between the Troika and the governments of Greece and Portugal where there has been a far greater degree of conditionality attached to SOE divestitures.

Title: Organisational Structure and Managerial Efficiency: A quasi-experimental analysis of German public theatres
Abstract: This paper examines the production technology and managerial efficiency of the performing arts sector in Germany using data on 79 theatres over a 32-year period. We examine how different organisational structures affect the efficiency of public theatres and find that theatres organised under public law are more efficient than theatres organised under private law. Using a difference-in-differences approach we examine the impact on efficiency of the exogenous demand shock experienced by theatres located near the East German border after reunification in 1990. We show that theatres organised under private law react positively to this competition shock as measured by their technical efficiency scores confirming that they respond better to market forces than theatres organised under public law.

Title: Utilising microsimulation to estimate new marginal returns to education: Ireland 1987-2011
Abstract: In this paper we utilise microsimulation techniques in the form of an income generation model and a tax/benefit model to estimate both the fiscal and net private return to education at a marginal level. This is carried out empirically using Irish data across the period 1987-2011 and is the first study to utilise these techniques in such a manner. The results indicate that a more generous tax/benefit system, combined with a greater state burden of the cost of education over the period 2000-2005 may have helped increase the individuals return to education, while reducing the state return from investing in education. However, this trend is revered between 2005-2011, as the fiscal crisis in Ireland forces significant changes to the Irish tax/benefit system.   The methodology employed allows us to specifically analyse the impact of various components of the tax/benefit system upon these returns across time and show the role of income tax changes upon the return to education for the individual and the state.
